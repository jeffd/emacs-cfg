Why there's an extra newline?
=============================

If you have a newline at the end of the snippet definition file, then
YASnippet will add a newline when you expanding a snippet. Please
don't add a newline at the end if you don't want it when you saving
the snippet file.

Note some editors will automatically add a newline for you. In Emacs,
if you set ``require-final-newline`` to ``t``, it will add the final
newline for you automatically.
